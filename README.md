Intended for users who have achieved minimum professional language proficiency, Parrot allows users to translate phrases in an article when they get stuck. Users can register, save article preferences and select articles to read. Phrases can be selected and Parrot will show a translation right above the selection! It is user-friendly and intuitive. Users can make comments and respond to comments from other users. The 'Parrot feature' allows the user to send a phrase and its translation to their mobile device for on the go review. Translated phrases are also added to a Vocabulary List that are accessible within the app.

###An comprehensive README is coming soon. Please see the link below for screenshots of my project.
